# Sherlock-Moriarty-Pig-Game
(I wanted to name the players so I named them Sherlock and Moriarty)
## GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players Sherlock and Moriarty (My favorite characters), playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
